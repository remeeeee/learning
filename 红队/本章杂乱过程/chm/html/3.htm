<h2>Step 1 - LAN networks configuration</h2>
<p>Normally, the clients and server are connected with A Hub, Wireless Hub, Switch 
  or Router. The network protocol between the server and clients is TCP/IP. Therefore 
  both the server and the clients have an IP address. The server IP address is 
  static and fixed. The clients IP address can be fixed or dynamic which is obtained 
  through DHCP. CCProxy only requires that the clients can ping through the server 
  IP address. We know that the server may have multiple IP addresses, but must 
  have one that is used to connect with other LAN clients. The IP address that 
  is used to connect with the other LAN client is called the proxy server address, 
  We generally assumed this to be 192.168.0.1.</p>
<p>If the clients and server have not yet been setup to have a connection, we 
  recommend allocate IP addresses like this at below:</p>

<p>How to detect whether ping Requests are transferring through between the clients 
  and server? At the client, in the &quot;start&quot; menu -&gt; &quot;run&quot; 
  -&gt; &quot;cmd&quot;, assuming that the server IP is 192.168.0.1, in the command 
  line, to type &quot;ping 192.168.0.1&quot; then press return. If the result 
  is similar to that at below, it means the client is connected to the server 
  successfully. </p>

<p>If the result is like that at below, it means the client cannot connect to 
  the server. </p>

<p>If the client cannot connect to the server, you need to check the IP address 
  settings and the connections to the Hub, Switch or Router on the clients and 
  server.</p>
